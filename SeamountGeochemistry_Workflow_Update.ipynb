    "### I. Problem Statement \n",
    "#### In an age where seeing the unseen is commonplace, scientists still have surprisingly few constraints on mantle dynamics beneath our feet. Studies performed at mid-ocean ridges attempt to address this gap in knowledge by examining chemistry of basalts produced at ridge axes where distance to the mantle is minimal (often less than 1 km). Ideally, those basalts are as close to representing the mantle as a geochemist can access. However, at fast-spreading ridges a continuous thermal barrier allows for efficient mixing of mantle material prior to eruption, so materials collected on-axis (the most common site for sampling) only represent an average composition. To probe any heterogeneities in the mantle, ~300 basalt samples were collected from a long seamount chain perpendicular to the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise in an attempt to by-pass homogenization mixing and see into the mantle. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### To assess heterogeneity, fractional crystallization, source mixing, and mantle melting models are compared to the 300 basalt samples. However, the stages from inputing parameters into the melting program (alphaMELTs) to producing visualizations of the results are arduous and time-consuming. This results in week-long modeling sessions that are frequently inadequate and need adjusted and re-run. To expedite the melt model results, this study will incorporate the computing power of Python to read the alphaMELTs output results, process the data, feed it into a script which plots the results in real-time without all of the intermediate, time-consuming steps. This will effectively reduce the time required to visualize the results so I can immediately decide which parameters to adjust, quickly adjust those, and automate getting updated results. "
